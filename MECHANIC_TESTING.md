# Mechanic Dashboard Testing Guide

## âœ… **Mechanic Dashboard is Now Working!**

The mechanic dashboard has been fully implemented with dynamic data fetching and real-time service request management.

### **What's Been Implemented:**

1. **Dynamic Mechanic Dashboard** (`/src/components/dashboards/dynamic-mechanic-dashboard.tsx`)
   - Real-time service requests from MongoDB
   - Role-based filtering (mechanics see pending requests + their assigned tasks)
   - Interactive task management (Accept, Start, Complete)
   - Online/Offline status toggle
   - Performance metrics and earnings tracking

2. **Role-Based Dashboard Routing** (`/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
   - Automatically shows correct dashboard based on user role
   - Users â†’ User Dashboard
   - Mechanics â†’ Mechanic Dashboard  
   - Admins â†’ User Dashboard (Admin dashboard TODO)

3. **Service Request Management API** (`/src/app/api/service-requests/[requestId]/route.ts`)
   - Accept pending requests â†’ Changes status to "assigned"
   - Start assigned tasks â†’ Changes status to "in-progress"  
   - Complete tasks â†’ Changes status to "completed"
   - Proper mechanic assignment and timeline tracking

4. **Sample Data Seeding** (`/src/app/api/seed/route.ts`)
   - Creates sample mechanic accounts for testing
   - Creates admin account
   - Pre-configured mechanic profiles with specialties

### **How to Test:**

#### **Step 1: Create Mechanic Accounts**
```bash
# Call the seed endpoint to create sample accounts
POST http://localhost:3000/api/seed
```

This creates:
- **Mechanic 1:** `john.martinez@roadguard.com` / `mechanic123`
- **Mechanic 2:** `sarah.chen@roadguard.com` / `mechanic123`  
- **Mechanic 3:** `mike.thompson@roadguard.com` / `mechanic123`
- **Admin:** `admin@roadguard.com` / `admin123`

#### **Step 2: Test the Flow**

1. **Create Service Requests:**
   - Sign in as a regular user
   - Go to `/request-service` 
   - Create some service requests

2. **Sign in as Mechanic:**
   - Use any mechanic email from above
   - Password: `mechanic123`
   - You'll automatically be redirected to mechanic dashboard

3. **Test Mechanic Actions:**
   - **View Requests:** See pending requests and your assigned tasks
   - **Accept Task:** Click "Accept Task" on pending requests
   - **Start Task:** Click "Start Task" on accepted requests  
   - **Complete Task:** Click "Mark Complete" on in-progress tasks
   - **Toggle Status:** Go Online/Offline to control availability

#### **Step 3: Multi-User Testing**

1. **User Session:** Create service requests
2. **Mechanic Session:** Accept and manage those requests
3. **Real-time Updates:** Changes are reflected immediately

### **Dashboard Features:**

#### **For Mechanics:**
- âœ… **Task Management:** Accept, start, and complete service requests
- âœ… **Performance Tracking:** Completed tasks, earnings, active requests
- âœ… **Availability Control:** Online/Offline status toggle
- âœ… **Real-time Data:** Live updates from MongoDB
- âœ… **Request Filtering:** See relevant requests (pending + assigned to you)
- âœ… **Customer Info:** View customer details and contact information
- âœ… **Service Details:** Full request information including vehicle details

#### **Technical Implementation:**
- âœ… **Authentication:** NextAuth.js with role-based access
- âœ… **API Integration:** Custom hooks for data fetching and mutations
- âœ… **Real-time Updates:** Automatic refresh after actions
- âœ… **Error Handling:** Proper error states and loading indicators
- âœ… **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop and mobile
- âœ… **Animations:** Framer Motion for smooth interactions

### **Navigation:**

- **Regular Users:** `/dashboard` â†’ User Dashboard
- **Mechanics:** `/dashboard` or `/mechanic` â†’ Mechanic Dashboard  
- **Admins:** `/dashboard` â†’ User Dashboard (Admin dashboard coming soon)

### **API Endpoints:**

- `GET /api/service-requests` - Get filtered requests based on role
- `PATCH /api/service-requests/[id]` - Update request status (mechanics only)
- `POST /api/seed` - Create sample users (development only)

The mechanic dashboard is now fully functional and ready for use! ðŸŽ‰
